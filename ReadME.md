# 🧠 SmartDoc: Pre-Visit Summary Tool for Doctors

SmartDoc is a product innovation designed to improve outpatient clinical workflows by reducing doctors’ cognitive load. It presents a concise, rule-based patient summary in a floating window format that supports rapid, informed decision-making—without needing to switch EHR tabs.
 
🏥 **Domain**: Outpatient Healthcare, EHR Usability  

---

## 🔹 Overview

Outpatient doctors are often overwhelmed by fragmented EHR systems that bury critical patient data across multiple tabs. This leads to reduced face-to-face time with patients and increased burnout. SmartDoc solves this by delivering key visit information—reason for visit, vitals, chronic conditions, medications, and red flags—in a single glance via a floating summary panel.

## 📌 Problem Statement

> “Nearly 70% of outpatient doctors struggle to find relevant patient information before a visit due to scattered EHR tabs—reducing patient interaction time and contributing to burnout.”  
> — Research from JAMA, NIH, Stanford (2023–2025)

---

## 🔍 Research & Validation

- Reviewed published findings from JAMA, Stanford Medicine, NIH, JMIR  
- Studied live EHR interfaces (e.g., PrognoCIS) to map friction points  
- Identified that poor EHR design is a key contributor to 40% of physician burnout  
- Found that doctors spend just 27% of their time with patients, vs. over 50% on EHR interaction

---

## 👥 Target Users

- **Primary User:** Outpatient Physicians (core users interacting with the summary tool)
- **Secondary Stakeholders:**
  - Medical Assistants (support data input like vitals or intake)
  - Clinical Admin Staff (assist with workflow or adoption)
  - ACO Leadership (approve, fund, or scale adoption across clinics)

---

## 📌 Hypothesis

Providing doctors with a smart, rule-driven pre-visit summary will reduce prep time by 25%, improve quality of care, and lower EHR fatigue.

---

## 📋 Proposed MVP Features

- Visit reason collected via intake forms, patient portals, or Mobile App entry  
- Current vitals (auto-filled by MAs)  
- Grouped red-flag conditions using rule-based logic  
- Medication and allergy history  
- Layout optimized for scan-read speed

---

## 📈 Expected Benefits

- Prep time reduced by 25%  
- Lower cognitive load from tab-switching  
- More patient interaction time  
- Simple overlay — no EHR integration for MVP

## 🚀 Future Roadmap

- Add natural language processing (NLP) to extract key patterns from past visit notes  
- Train AI to highlight high-risk patients using rule-based + ML risk scores  
- Enable doctor-specific customization for summary display  
- Integrate with EHR systems using HL7/FHIR standards in long-term versions
